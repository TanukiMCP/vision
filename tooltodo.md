# tanukimcp-vision MCP Server Tool

## Project Overview
A computer vision-based task execution controller that uses AI to automate interactions with any application, not limited to web browsers. Unlike selector-based tools like Puppeteer, this tool uses visual recognition to identify and interact with UI elements.

## Project Setup
- [ ] Configure initial package.json with dependencies
- [ ] Create mcp.json configuration for easy installation

## Core Components
- [ ] Screenshot Capture Module
  - [ ] Implement full window screenshot capability
  - [ ] Optimize for performance (speed and quality balance)
  - [ ] Support for capturing specific application windows
  
- [ ] Coordinate Grid System
  - [ ] Develop high-resolution coordinate mapping for screenshots
  - [ ] Create calibration functionality for different screen resolutions
  - [ ] Implement coordinate translation between virtual and physical screen

- [ ] Visual Element Recognition (AI)
  - [ ] Integrate computer vision models for UI element detection
  - [ ] Train/fine-tune models to recognize common UI patterns
  - [ ] Implement confidence scoring for element identification

- [ ] Cursor Control System
  - [ ] Create visual cursor representation
  - [ ] Implement smooth cursor movement animation
  - [ ] Develop precision targeting for identified coordinates

- [ ] Interaction Engine
  - [ ] Implement mouse actions (left/right click, hover, drag)
  - [ ] Add keyboard input capabilities
  - [ ] Support scrolling and navigation actions
  - [ ] Create macro capability for common action sequences

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Research existing screen capture libraries for different OS platforms
- [ ] Evaluate computer vision models suitable for UI element recognition
- [ ] Define API structure for the MCP server
- [ ] Design protocol for communication between AI and execution layer
- [ ] Create CLI for local installation and configuration
- [ ] Set up logging and debugging tools
- [ ] Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Documentation
- [ ] Create user installation guide
- [ ] Develop API documentation
- [ ] Write usage examples and tutorials
- [ ] Document architecture and design decisions
